# Treatment Duration Calculator 🩺

This is a simple Python program that helps calculate how many days a patient should take a medication, based on the total dose per kilogram of body weight.

## 💊 What it does

- Receives the medication name, dose (mg/kg), and the patient's weight.
- Calculates the total dose and estimates how many days of treatment are needed.
- Asks for the start date of treatment.
- Shows the end date of the treatment.
- Calculates how many days are left if the treatment has already started.

## 🛠 How to use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter:
   - Name of the drug (e.g., isotretinoin).
   - Total mg per kg required.
   - Patient's weight.
3. Enter the date the treatment started.
4. Indicate if today is the first day or input the current date to see how many days are left.

## 👩‍⚕️ Purpose

I built this tool to support healthcare professionals by simplifying routine medical dosage calculations. It's my first step toward building intelligent tools for the medical field.

## 📌 Next steps

- Add input validation.
- Improve language and UX.
- Expand to support multiple patients.
- Create a graphical interface (GUI).
